## 📖 About Me

My interest in engineering started with hands-on experimentation using **Arduino**, where I learned how small changes in code could produce visible, real-world results. That experience shaped how I approach software today: focusing on understanding problems clearly and building practical solutions.

I work primarily on the frontend while staying comfortable across the stack. Most of my work involves building web applications that are easy to maintain, performant, and pleasant to use.

## 🤖 AI Integration

I use AI where it adds real value to products.

- Building features with **Vercel AI SDK** and **OpenAI APIs**, such as streaming responses and user-facing AI tools.
- Implementing data-aware interactions (RAG-style patterns) so users can work with their own content inside applications.
- Focusing on use cases like content assistance and workflow automation, not demos or experiments.

---

## 🏗️ Web Architecture

- **Next.js:** App Router, React Server Components, and server-first patterns.
- **Astro:** Content-focused sites using Islands Architecture and minimal client-side JavaScript.
- **Jamstack & CMS:** Headless workflows with **Sanity**, **Contentful**, and **BigCommerce**.
